Hello GitHub Community,

I am pleased to present to you the dashboard I have developed for data analysis, showcasing call center performance indicators for October 2020. This dashboard combines numerical data and interactive graphs to provide a clear and direct understanding of customer interactions and satisfaction levels across various communication channels.

This work is the result of meticulous data analysis, where the graphics show the distribution of calls based on states, categorized by call reasons, and also measures agent performance against Service Level Agreement standards.

I invite you all to review the code and details, and I hope you find inspiration for your own projects in it. Please feel free to add your notes and suggestions to enhance this work.
